    <div><p>A neural network is a network or circuit of neurons, or in a modern sense, 
      an artificial neural network, composed of artificial neurons or nodes. Thus a neural network 
      is either a biological neural network, made up of real biological neurons, or an 
      artificial neural network, for solving artificial intelligence (AI) problems. The connections of 
      the biological neuron are modeled as weights. A positive weight reflects an excitatory connection,
      while negative values mean inhibitory connections. All inputs are modified by a weight and summed. 
      This activity is referred to as a linear combination. Finally, an activation function controls
       the amplitude of the output. For example, an acceptable range of output is usually between 0 and 1,
        or it could be âˆ’1 and 1.</p>

        <p> These artificial networks may be used for predictive modeling, adaptive control and applications 
      where they can be trained via a dataset. Self-learning resulting from experience can occur
       within networks, which can derive conclusions from a complex and seemingly 
       unrelated set of information.</p></div>

         <p>
          A biological neural network is composed of a groups of chemically connected or functionally 
          associated neurons. A single neuron may be connected to many other neurons and the total number
           of neurons and connections in a network may be extensive. Connections, called synapses, are usually
           formed from axons to dendrites, though dendrodendritic synapses[3] and other connections are 
           possible. Apart from the electrical signaling, there are other forms of signaling that arise from 
            neurotransmitter diffusion.</p>

        <p>  Artificial intelligence, cognitive modeling, and neural networks are information processing 
          paradigms inspired by the way biological neural systems process data. Artificial intelligence and 
          cognitive modeling try to simulate some properties of biological neural networks. In the artificial
           intelligence field, artificial neural networks have been applied successfully to speech recognition,
           image analysis and adaptive control, in order to construct software agents (in computer and video
            games) or autonomous robots.</p>
          
         <p> Historically, digital computers evolved from the von Neumann model, and operate via the execution of
            explicit instructions via access to memory by a number of processors. On the other hand, the origins 
            of neural networks are based on efforts to model information processing in biological systems. Unlike 
            the von Neumann model, neural network computing does not separate memory and processing.</p>
          
          <p>Neural network theory has served both to better identify how the neurons in the brain function and 
            to provide the basis for efforts to create artificial intelligence.</p>
